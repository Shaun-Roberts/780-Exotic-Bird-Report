# 780-Exotic-Bird-Report
The file is too large to send in an email as the animated heatmaps are embedded in the pdf. This is a work around and alows us to store both the pdf and the heatmaps in an mp4 format somewhere.

"Report.pdf" is the report.
"bird_dataset_for_heatmap.csv" is the final dataset used to create the heatmaps.
The 15 second heatmaps are in the 15 second Heatmaps folder in an mp4 format.
The 20 second heatmaps are in the 20 second Heatmaps folder in an mp4 format.
"NZ_Heatmap_All_Species.png" is the static heatmap of all of New Zealand.
